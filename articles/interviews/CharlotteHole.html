  <div class="articleText">
  <p class="articleQuestion">LCL: What does your typical day consist of?</p>
  <p class="articleAnswer">CH: Emails, replying to emails, losing track of time, never
really sticking to deadlines. When the weather is good, I try
to create content, depending on where I am, London or
wherever. I make sure I have an Instagram post up that day or
sponsored content.</p>
<p class="articleQuestion">How do you overcome any creative challenges?</p>
<p class="articleAnswer">Getting out and going somewhere new, finding new surroundings.
Whether it is switching up coffee shops I work in, or finding
inspiration elsewhere. Travel inspires me, when I come back I
feel really regenerated.</p>
<p class="articleQuestion">How did you get started with your career?</p>
<p class="articleAnswer">I was working in Urban Outfitters five years ago when I was
Eighteen, whilst I was working there I started doing their
social media and styling. Then I started my own blog, also
Kavita (@shewearsfashion) was my inspiration to start my blog.</p>

<div class="articleText">
  <p class="articleQuestion">If you weren’t blogging, what would you do?</p>
  <p class="articleAnswer">I probably would be interning for a magazine or working in a
head office for a fashion brand.</p>
  <p class="articleQuestion">What was the most exciting moment of your career so far?</p>
  <p class="articleAnswer">Probably the campaign with Schwarzkopf and seeing my face on
the box whenever I go into Superdrug or boots. Ooh or being in
an advert on TV was pretty crazy. It has always been a dream
of mine, I remember being with my mum and dad and seeing my
friends on TV and just wanting that.</p>
<p class="articleQuestion">Do you have any blogging tips?</p>
<p class="articleAnswer">Be yourself entirely. Create the content you want to create.
Don’t be a clone or copy other things that people do. Also
consistency is important, especially if you are starting so
people know when you are going to post and what your blog is
about.</p>
<p class="articleQuestion">What words do you live by?</p>
<p class="articleAnswer">Happiness first, if you aren’t happy, don’t do it. Whether you
are unhappy in a job, just don’t do it.</p>

<div class="articleText">
  <p class="articleQuestion">On the internet people are faced with hate, how would you say
you deal with it?</p>
  <p class="articleAnswer">If I do get hate, most times I leave it or remove it. If I do
reply, sometimes I really just want to call someone out,
because they have the wrong idea about me and tell them how it
actually is, because they don’t know everything about me. I
don’t want to start an argument though.</p>
  <p class="articleQuestion">What songs are on your playlist right now?</p>
  <p class="articleAnswer">A track from the ‘end of the fucking world’ a series of
Netflix, or naked elephant, raspberry kiss or I’ve been
listening to a lot of Khalid recently.</p>
<p class="articleQuestion">What is one item you cannot live without?</p>
<p class="articleAnswer">My moisturiser, I have really sensitive skin and it can get
really dry. Also, Johnson’s baby wipes are the best baby
wipes.</p>
<p class="articleQuestion">What has your experience with love been like?</p>
<p class="articleAnswer">I love to love, I was in a long relationship and then I jumped
into a relationship with my current boyfriend Max. I love
relationships, even if I am heartbroken I can fall back in
love.</p>
<p class="articleQuestion">What did you want to be when you grow up?</p>
<p class="articleAnswer">A fashion designer, I really wanted to create catwalk fashion.
I went to college to do catwalk fashion and ended up doing
photography instead.</p>
