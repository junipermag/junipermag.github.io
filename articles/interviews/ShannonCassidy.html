  <p class="articleQuestion">LCL: What do you value in a photograph?</p>
  <p class="articleAnswer">SC: If you have seen my work you will know i value colour and light.
  Composition is also a big deal for me, I’m a little bit OCD when it
  comes to trying to get my capture symmetrical and in the right
  composition. Seeing good composition in someone else's work is a
  satisfying feeling for me, it means they have a good eye in seeing
  what is art or what can be interpreted into art.
  I am a major perfectionist when it comes to photography. It's a
  blessing and a curse I always say ha-ha.</p>
  <p>Describe your work in three words</p>
  <br>
  <p>Creative, methodical and colourful.</p>

  <p class="articleQuestion">Where does your inspiration come from?</p>
  <p class="articleAnswer">A big inspiration of mine is photographer Brandon Woelfel. I came
  across him over a year ago on Instagram whilst being bored. I looked
  on his page and I was just in awe of his work. It made me realize
  this is what I want to do. This is exactly what I love: the cold
  colours, the use of lights, bokeh, his creativeness in his
  portraits. It was almost too good to be true.</p>
  <p class="articleQuestion">What is it about photography that you enjoy the most?</p>
  <p class="articleAnswer">What I enjoy most is getting to do long exposure. This has to be
  done during the night as it is vital for this to work. I feel it
  makes my photography or anyone’s photography look more exciting and
  engaging as it's something different from the norm. When I see a
  good opportunity for capturing long exposure I'm on it straight away
  whether it's car light trails, star trails, capturing long exposure
  light reflections in the sea or puddles. But it needs to have an
  exciting vibe about it, so I wouldn't take the photo just for the
  sake of it, I would need to see and feel if it would be an exciting
  capture and if I would be able to edit it in my style, if that makes
  sense.</p>

  <p class="articleQuestion">How have people influenced your work through creating portraits?</p>
  <p class="articleAnswer">When I see a portrait of someone, usually it's just a person in the
  centre of a photo looking serious, this to me seems boring and not
  exciting. When I create portraits, they need to be creative and have
  something astonishing about them. So while observing other
  photographers portraits they could either intrigue me and make me
  want to copy them in my own way (a lot like Brandon Woelfel's work),
  or not interest me at all.</p>
  <p class="articleQuestion">What do you want to be when you grow up?</p>
  <p class="articleAnswer">When I grow up I want to be an Astrophotographer for NASA because I
  love taking photos of the night sky, the stars and trying to capture
  the milky way and it would be amazing if I could capture something
  beyond the night sky e.g. nebula clouds or even planets. It's an
  ambitious and a 'really-out-there' job but that's why I like it, and
  I've always been fascinated by the night sky and the constellations.
  Taking photos for a company like NASA would be an absolute honour
  and dream come true, however I still would want to do the
  photography art work I'm currently doing today as I enjoy it, but
  maybe as a side thing.</p>
